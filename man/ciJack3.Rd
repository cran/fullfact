\title{Jackknife confidence intervals 3}
\description{
Extracts jackknife confidence intervals for additive genetic, non-additive genetic, and maternal
variance components. Also extracts intervals for additional fixed and random effects.

\usage{
ciJack3(comp, full, remain = NULL, level = 95, rnd_r = 3, rnd_p = 1, trait = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{comp}{Data frame of jackknife resampling results}
  \item{full}{
A vector of raw observed additive, non-additive, maternal, and total variance component values
for from the full observed data set, i.e. c(additive, non-additive, maternal, total). Followed by
any other components in the order of the vector \emph{remain},
i.e. c(additive, non-additive, maternal, total, component1, component2, ...).
}
  \item{remain}{Vector of column names for additional effects}
  \item{level}{Confidence level, as a percentage. Default is 95.}
  \item{rnd_r}{Number of decimal places to round the confidence interval of raw values.}
  \item{rnd_p}{Number of decimal places to round the confidence interval of percentage values.}
  \item{trait}{Optional label for the phenotypic trait.}
}
\details{
Used for jackknife resampling results produced using \emph{JackLmer3} for normal data or
\emph{JackGlmer3} for non-normal data.
Jackknife confidence intervals, using pseudo-values are described by Efron and Tibshirani (1993).
The standard errors are calculated from the pseudo-values and the Student's \emph{t} distribution is used
to provide the lower and upper confidence values. For delete-\emph{d} jackknife resampling,
\emph{M} degrees of freedom are used for producing the confidence interval (Martin et al. 2004):
\emph{M = N / d}, where \emph{N} is the total number of observations and d is the number of
deleted observations. That is, \emph{M} is the number of row in the jackknife resampling results.
Large values of \emph{M}, such as 1,000, can translate to the delete-d jackknife resampling
method approaching bootstrap resampling expectations (Efron & Tibshirani 1993).

\value{
Prints a data frame containing the lower, median, and upper values of the jackknife confidence
interval for additive genetic, non-additive genetic, maternal variance components, and any
additional fixed effect and random effect variance components. Values are presented as raw and
percentages of the total variance value within each row.
