\description{

Full factorial breeding designs are useful for quantifying the amount of additive
genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance that explain phenotypic
traits. Such variance estimates are important for examining evolutionary potential.
Traditionally, full factorial mating designs have been analyzed using a two-
way analysis of variance, which may produce negative variance values and is
not suited for unbalanced designs. Mixed-effects models do not produce negative
variance values and are suited for unbalanced designs. However, extracting
the variance components, calculating significance values, and estimating confidence
intervals and/or power values for the components are not straightforward
using traditional analytic methods.

In this package we address these issues and facilitate the analysis of full factorial mating
designs with mixed-effects models. The observed data functions extract the variance explained
by random and fixed effects and provide their significance. We then calculate
the additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance components
explaining the phenotype. In particular, we integrate nonnormal error structures for estimating
these components for nonnormal data types. The resampled data functions are used to produce
bootstrap confidence intervals, which can then be plotted using a simple function.
This package will facilitate the analyses of full factorial mating designs in R, especially
for the analysis of binary, proportion, and/or count data types and for the ability to incorporate
additional random and fixed effects and power analyses.
