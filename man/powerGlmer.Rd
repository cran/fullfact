\title{Power analysis for non-normal data}
\description{
Extracts the power values of dam, sire, and dam by sire variance components from a
generalized linear mixed-effect model using the \emph{glmer} function of the
\emph{lme4} package.
}
\usage{
powerGlmer(varcomp, nval, fam_link, alpha = 0.05, nsim = 100, poisLog = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{varcomp}{Vector of known dam, sire, and dam by sire variance components, i.e. c(dam, sire, dam x sire).}
  \item{nval}{Vector of known dam, sire, and offspring per family sample sizes, i.e. c(dam, sire, offspring).}
  \item{fam_link}{The family and link in family(link) format. Supported options are binomial(link="logit"), binomial(link="probit"), poisson(link="log"), and poisson(link="sqrt").}
  \item{alpha}{Statistical significance value. Default is 0.05.}
  \item{nsim}{Number of simulations. Default is 100.}
  \item{poisLog}{The residual variance component value if using poisson(link="log").}
}
\details{
Extracts the dam, sire, dam, and dam by sire power values.
The residual variance component for the \emph{fam_links} are described by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2010, 2013).
Power values are calculated by stochastically simulation data and then calculating the proportion of
significance values less than \emph{alpha} for each component (Bolker 2008).
Significance values for the random effects are determined using likelihood ratio tests (Bolker et al. 2009).
}
\value{
Prints a data frame with the sample sizes, variance component inputs, variance component outputs, and power values.

\note{
The Laplace approximation is used because there were fewer disadvantages relative to penalized
quasi-likelihood and Gauss-Hermite quadrature parameter estimation (Bolker et al. 2009).
That is, penalized quasi-likelihood is not recommended for count responses with means less than 5 and
binary responses with less than 5 successes per group. Gauss-Hermite quadrature is not recommended for
more than two or three random effects because of the rapidly declining analytical speed with the
increasing number of random effects.
