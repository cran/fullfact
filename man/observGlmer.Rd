\title{Variance components for non-normal data}
\description{
Extracts additive genetic, non-additive genetic, and maternal variance components
from a generalized linear mixed-effect model using the \emph{glmer} function of the \emph{lme4} package.
Model random effects are dam, sire, and dam by sire.
}
\usage{
observGlmer(observ, dam, sire, response, fam_link, quasi = F)
}
\arguments{
  \item{observ}{Data frame of observed data.}
  \item{dam}{Column name containing dam (female) parent identity information.}
  \item{sire}{Column name containing sire (male) parent identity information.}
  \item{response}{Column name containing the offspring (response) phenotype values.}
  \item{fam_link}{
The family and link in family(link) format. Supported options are binomial(link="logit"), binomial(link="probit"), poisson(link="log"), and poisson(link="sqrt").
}
  \item{quasi}{Incorporate overdispersion or quasi-error structure.}
}
\details{
Laplace approximation parameter estimation is used, which is a true likelihood method (Bolker et al. 2009).
For the overdispersion option, an observation-level random effect is added to the model (Atkins et al. 2013).
Extracts the dam, sire, dam, and dam by sire variance components.
The residual variance component for the \emph{fam_links} are described by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2010, 2013).
Calculates the total variance component. Calculates the additive genetic, non-additive genetic, and
maternal variance components (see Lynch and Walsh 1998, p. 603).
Significance values for the random effects are determined using likelihood ratio tests (Bolker et al. 2009).
}
\value{
A list object containing the raw variance components, the variance components as a percentage
of the total variance component. Also, contains the difference in AIC and BIC, and likelihood ratio
test Chi-square and p-value for all random effects.

\note{
The Laplace approximation is used because there were fewer disadvantages relative to penalized
quasi-likelihood and Gauss-Hermite quadrature parameter estimation (Bolker et al. 2009).
That is, penalized quasi-likelihood is not recommended for count responses with means less than 5 and
binary responses with less than 5 successes per group. Gauss-Hermite quadrature is not recommended for
more than two or three random effects because of the rapidly declining analytical speed with the
increasing number of random effects.
